                        <p>The British Residency of Lucknow, which is also a Residential Complex served as the headquarters for the generals of the British East India Company.

The ruins are now protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. The Residency also hosts a light and sound reminiscing the 1857 revolt show every evening. </p>

                    <p>This place defines Lucknow food in so many ways. Whoever visits this place, cannot forget the taste of these uniquely spiced kebabs for a very long time.

Although the restaurant is a bit small, it does not matter since the mouth-watering biryani is all the reason you need to go here. The Awadhi biryani is made of meat and rice. They are cooked separately and then mixed over dum. The flavours are very light but together they pack quite a punch. The biryani is absolutely sinful and often the cheat meal of all Lucknowis.</p>

                    <p>I have been visited to lucknow for my National competition. After the match we decided to explore the city. First we visited to Bada Imambada. Its the old palace of the Nawabs. A massive and mind blowing palace which has its own history. There is a place called Bhool Bhulaiya in the Bada Imambada where any one can lost without proper guide and it also describe its ancient stone carvings</p>

                    <p>The most Fascinating thing about Lucknow is its Imambada. As you enter to Imambada, you can hire a guide who will tell and reveal some amazing facts about Imambada. There is clothes factory in Lucknow too where you can closely view imprinting on clothes, also the chicken embroidery on clothes. Lucknow zoo is also a fascinating thing of Lucknow. Clock Tower, Gautam Buddha Park, Marine Drive also attract visitors.</p>
